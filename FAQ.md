# FAQ

### What metrics does this exporter report?

The Cloud Foundry Prometheus Exporter gets information from the [Cloud Foundry API][cf_api]. The metrics that are being [reported][cf_exporter_metrics] are enumerations of administrative information, and include:

* Applications information:
  * Application information (id, name, space id and name, organization id and name)
  * Application Instances
  * Application Memory
  * Application Disk Quota
* Routes information:
  *  Route information (id, host, path, domain id, space id, service instance id)
* Organizations information:
  * Organization information (id, name)
  * Organization Quota information
* Security Groups information:
  * Security Group information (id, name)
* Services information:
  * Service information (id, label)
* Service Bindings information:
  * Service Binding information (id, application id, service instance id)
* Service Instances information:
  * Service Instance information (id, name, service plan id, space id, type)
* Service Plans information:
  * Service Plan information (id, name, service id)
* Spaces information:
  * Space information (id, name)
  * Space Quota information
* Stacks information:
  * Stack information (id, name)

### What are the caveats when using this exporter?

There are several collectors that require quite some resources on the `cloud_controller` and may result in a very poor CF API performance. To prevent this, consider setting a reasonable `scrape_interval` when using this exporter or creating a [Read-Only Cloud Controller API server][read-only-cc].


### How can I get detailed application metrics like CPU & Memory?

The goal of this exporter is just to provide administrative information about your Cloud Foundry environment. If you want to get detailed runtime application metrics, then you will need to use a different exporter, specifically, the [Cloud Foundry Firehose Prometheus Exporter][firehose_exporter], who will get `Container Metrics` from the [Cloud Foundry Firehose][firehose].

### Can I combine labels from a different exporter to get readable names?

Yes. You can combine this exporter with another exporter as far as there is a metric matching label.

For example, if you want to combine the `Container Metrics` from the [Cloud Foundry Firehose Prometheus Exporter][firehose_exporter] with this exporter you can run a query like:

```
firehose_container_metric_cpu_percentage
  * on(application_id)
  group_left(application_name, organization_name, space_name)
  cf_application_info
```

The *on* specifies the matching label, in this case, the *application_id*. The *group_left* specifies what labels (*application_name*, *organization_name*, *space_name*) from the right metric (*cf_application_info*) should be merged into the left metric (*firehose_container_metric_cpu_percentage*).

### How can I enable only a particular collector?

The `filter.collectors` command flag allows you to filter what collectors will be enabled (if not set, all collectors will be enabled by default). Possible values are `Applications`, `Organizations`, `Routes`, `SecurityGroups`, `ServiceBindings`, `ServiceInstances`, `ServicePlans`, `Services`, `Spaces`, `Stacks` (or a combination of them).

### Can I target multiple Cloud Foundry API endpoints with a single exporter instance?

No, this exporter only supports targetting a single [Cloud Foundry API][cf_api] endpoint. If you want to get metrics from several endpoints, you will need to use one exporter per endpoint. You can use the `cf.deployment-name` command flag to report the CF name (as a metric label) where metrics come from.
